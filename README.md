Performance of **vector element sum** using [float] vs [bfloat16] as the
*storage type*.

This experiment was for comparing the performance between:
1. Find sum of numbers, stored as **float**.
2. Find sum of numbers, stored as **bfloat16**.

Both approaches were attempted on a number of vector sizes, running each
approach 5 times per size to get a good time measure. While it seemed to me
that **bfloat16** method would be a clear winner because of reduced memory
bandwidth requirement, for some reason it is **only slightly faster**. This is
possibly because memory loads are anyway always 32-bit. The only reason using
*bfloat16* is slightly faster could possibly be because it allows data to be
retained in cache for a longer period of time (because of its small size).
Note that neither approach makes use of *SIMD instructions* which are
available on all modern hardware.

All outputs are saved in [gist] and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. This
experiment was done with guidance from [Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee] and
[Prof. Kishore Kothapalli].
